## Why???

We built this in response to the severe tech scalping situation that's happening right now. Almost every tech product
that's coming out right now is being instantly brought out by scalping groups and then resold at at insane prices. $699
GPUs are being listed for $1700 on eBay, and these scalpers are buying 40 cards while normal consumers can't get a
single one. Preorders for the PS5 are being resold for nearly $1000. Our take on this is that if we release a bot that
anyone can use, for free, then the number of items that scalpers can buy goes down and normal consumers can buy items
for MSRP.

**If everyone is botting, then no one is botting.**

## Got a question?

Read through this document and the cheat sheet linked in the next sections. See the [FAQs](#frequently-asked-questions)
if that does not answer your questions.

## Installation

Community user Easy_XII has created a great cheat sheet for getting started. It includes specific and additional steps
for Windows users as well as useful product and configuration information. Please start
with [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kZ0SNC97DFVRStnrdsJ8xbQO1m42v7svy93kUdtX48) to get you started
and to answer any initial questions you may have about setup.

**Note:** The above document is community maintained and managed. The authors of Fairgame do not control the contents,
so use some common sense when configuring the bot as both the bot and the sites we interact with change over time. For
example, do not ask us why the bot does not purchase an item whose price has changed to $8.49 when the _minimum_
purchase price is set to $10 in the configuration file that YOU are supposed to update

### General

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies. Hop in
my [Discord](https://discord.gg/4rfbNKrmnC) if you have ideas, need help or just want to tell us about how you got your
new toys.

To get started, there are two options:

#### Releases

To get the latest release as a convenient package, download it directly from
the [Releases](https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/fairgame/releases)
page on GitHub. The "Source code" zip or tar file are what you'll want. This can be downloaded and extracted into a
directory of your choice (e.g. C:\fairgame).

#### Git

If you want to manage the code via Git, you'll first need to clone this repository. If you are unfamiliar with Git,
follow the [guide](https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/fairgame/wiki/How-to-use-GitHub-Desktop-App) on how to do that on
our Wiki . You *can* use the "Download Zip" button on the GitHub repository's homepage but this makes receiving updates
more difficult. If you can get setup with the GitHub Desktop app, updating to the latest version of the bot takes 1
click.

!!! YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE 3.8 BRANCH OF PYTHON, 3.9.0 BREAKS DEPENDENCIES !!!

It is best if you use the newest version (3.8.7) but 3.8.5 and 3.8.6 should also work. 3.8.0 does not.

```shell
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell 
pipenv install
```

NOTE: YOU SHOULD RUN `pipenv shell` and `pipenv install` ANY TIME YOU UPDATE, IN CASE THE DEPENDENCIES HAVE CHANGED!

Run it

```shell
python app.py

Usage: app.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  amazon
```

### Platform Specific

These instructions are supplied by community members and any adjustments, corrections, improvements or clarifications
are welcome. These are typically created during installation in a single environment, so there may be caveats or changes
necessary for your environment. This isn't intended to be a definitive guide, but a starting point as validation that a
platform can/does work. Please report back any suggestions to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDY2QBtAW6) feedback
channel.

### Installation Raspberry Pi 4 (2 GB+)

This is an abridged version of the community created document by UnidentifiedWarlock and Judarius.  It can be 
found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUxXhATZ8sZOJxdh3AIY6OGqwLRmrAcPikKZAwphIE8/edit). If the steps here
don't work on your Pi 4, look there for additional options. This hasn't been tested on a Pi 3, but given enough RAM to
run Chrome, it may very well work. Let us know. 

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libzbar-dev clang 

version=3.8.7

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/$version/Python-$version.tgz

tar zxf Python-$version.tgz
cd Python-$version
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j4
sudo make altinstall

sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
git clone https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/fairgame
cd fairgame/
pip3 install pipenv
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/.local/bin
pipenv shell 
pipenv install
cp /usr/bin/chromedriver /home/fairgame/.local/share/virtualenvs/fairgame-<RANDOMCHARS>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/chromedriver_py/chromedriver_linux64
```

Leave this Terminal window open.

Open the following file in a text editor:

`/home/$USER/.local/share/virtualenvs/fairgame-<RANDOMCHARS>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/common/service.py`

Edit line 38 from

`self.path = executable`

to

`self.path = "chromedriver"`

Then save and close the file.

## Usage

### Amazon

The following flags are specific to the Amazon scripts. They the `[OPTIONS]` to be passed on the command-line to control
the behavior of Amazon scanning and purchasing. These can be added at the command line or added to a batch file/shell
script (see `_Amazon.bat` in the root folder of the project). **NOTE:** `--test` flag has been added to `_Amazon.bat`
file by default. This should be deleted after you've verified that the bot works correctly for you. If you don't want
your `_Amazon.bat`
to be deleted when you update, you should rename it to something else.

#### Amazon flags ####

```shell
python app.py amazon --help

Usage: app.py amazon option

Options:
  --no-image          Do not load images
  --headless          Runs Chrome in headless mode.
  --test              Run the checkout flow but do not actually purchase the
                      item[s]

  --delay FLOAT       Time to wait between checks for item[s]
  --checkshipping     Factor shipping costs into reserve price and look for
                      items with a shipping price

  --detailed          Take more screenshots. !!!!!! This could cause you to
                      miss checkouts !!!!!!

  --used              Show used items in search listings.
  --single-shot       Quit after 1 successful purchase
  --no-screenshots    Take NO screenshots, do not bother asking for help if
                      you use this... Screenshots are the best tool we have
                      for troubleshooting

  --disable-presence  Disable Discord Rich Presence functionallity
  --disable-sound     Disable local sounds.  Does not affect Apprise
                      notification sounds.

                      none

  --p TEXT            Pass in encryption file password as argument
  --log-stock-check   Will log each stock check to terminal and log file
  --shipping-bypass   Bot will attempt to click "Ship to this Address" button,
                      if it pops up during checkout. 
                      USE THIS OPTION AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
                      NOTE: There is no functionality to choose payment
                      option, so bot may still fail during checkout
                      
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

#### Configuration

Make a copy of `amazon_config.template_json` and rename to `amazon_config.json`. Edit it according to the ASINs you are
interested in purchasing.  [*What's an
ASIN?*](https://www.datafeedwatch.com/blog/amazon-asin-number-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-get-it#how-to-find-asin)

* `asin_groups` indicates the number of ASIN groups you want to use.
* `asin_list_x` list of ASINs for products you want to purchase. You must locate these (see Discord or lookup the ASIN
  on product pages).
    * The first time an item from list "x" is in stock and under its associated reserve, it will purchase it.
    * If the purchase is successful, the bot will not buy anything else from list "x".
    * Use sequential numbers for x, starting from 1. x can be any integer from 1 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616
* `reserve_min_x` set a minimum limit to consider for purchasing an item. If a seller has a listing for a 700 dollar
  item a 1 dollar, it's likely fake.
* `reserve_max_x` is the most amount you want to spend for a single item (i.e., ASIN) in `asin_list_x`. Does not include
  tax. If --checkshipping flag is active, this includes shipping listed on offer page.
* `amazon_website` amazon domain you want to use. smile subdomain appears to work better, if available in your
  country. [*What is Smile?*](https://org.amazon.com/)

##### Examples

One unique product with one ASIN (e.g., Segway Ninebot S and GoKart Drift Kit Bundle) :

```json
{
  "asin_groups": 1,
  "asin_list_1": [
    "B07K7NLDGT"
  ],
  "reserve_min_1": 450,
  "reserve_max_1": 500,
  "amazon_website": "smile.amazon.com"
}
```

One general product with multiple ASINS (e.g 16 GB USB drive 2 pack)

```json
{
  "asin_groups": 1,
  "asin_list_1": [
    "B07JH53M4T",
    "B085M1SQ9S",
    "B00E9W1ULS"
  ],
  "reserve_min_1": 15,
  "reserve_max_1": 20,
  "amazon_website": "smile.amazon.com"
}
```

Two general products with multiple ASINS and different price points (e.g. 16 GB USB drive 2 pack and a statue of The
Thinker)

```json
{
  "asin_groups": 2,
  "asin_list_1": [
    "B07JH53M4T",
    "B085M1SQ9S",
    "B00E9W1ULS"
  ],
  "reserve_min_1": 15,
  "reserve_max_1": 20,
  "asin_list_2": [
    "B006HPI2A2",
    "B00N54S1WW"
  ],
  "reserve_min_2": 50,
  "reserve_max_2": 75,
  "amazon_website": "smile.amazon.com"
}
```

If you wanted to watch another product, you'd add a third list (e.g. `asin_list_3`) and associated min/max pricing and
increase the `asin_groups` to 3. Add as many lists as are needed, keeping in mind that the main distinction between
lists is the min/max price boundaries. Once any ASIN is purchased from an ASIN list, that list is remove from the hunt
until FairGame is restarted.

#### Start Up

Previously your username and password were entered into the config file, this is no longer the case. On first launch the
bot will prompt you for your credentials. You will then be asked for a password to encrypt them. Once done, your
encrypted credentials will be stored in
`amazon_credentials.json`. If you ever forget your encryption password, just delete this file and the next launch of the
bot will recreate it. An example of this will look like the following:

```shell
python app.py amazon
INFO Initializing Apprise handler
INFO Initializing other notification handlers
INFO Enabled Handlers: ['Audio']
INFO No credential file found, let's make one
Amazon login ID: <your email address>
Amazon Password: <your amazon password>
INFO Create a password for the credential file
Credential file password: <a password used to encrypt your amazon credentials>
Verify credential file password: <the same password that was entered above>
INFO Credentials safely stored.
```

Starting the bot when you have created an encrypted file:

```shell
python app.py amazon --test
INFO Initializing Apprise handler
INFO Initializing other notification handlers
INFO Enabled Handlers: ['Audio']
Reading credentials from: amazon_credentials.json
Credential file password: <enter the previously created password>
```

Example usage:

```commandline
python app.py amazon --test
...

## ~~Best Buy~~

Best Buy is currently deprecated because we don't yet have an effective way to determine item availability without
scraping and processing the product pages individually. Future updates may see this functionality return, but the
current code isn't reliable for high demand items and checkout automation has become increasingly hard due to anti-bot
measures taken by Best Buy.

Original code still exists, but provides very little utility. A 3rd party stock notification service would probably
serve as a better solution at Best Buy.

~~This is fairly basic right now. Just login to the best buy website in your default browser and then run the command as
follows:~~

```
python app.py bestbuy --sku [SKU]
```

~~Example:~~

```
python python app.py bestbuy - -sku 6429440
```

## Notifications

### Sounds

Local sounds are provided as a means to give you audible cues to what is happening. The notification sound plays for
notable events (e.g., start up, product found for purchase) during the scans. An alarm notification will play when user
interaction is necessary. This is typically when all automated options have been exhausted. Lastly, a purchase
notification sound will play if the bot if successful. These local sounds can be disabled via the command-line
and [tested](#testing-notifications) along with other notification methods

### Apprise

Notifications are now handled by Apprise. Apprise lets you send notifications to a large number of supported
notification services. Check https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki for a detailed list.

To enable Apprise notifications, make a copy of `apprise.conf_template` in the `config` directory and name it
`apprise.conf`. Then add apprise formatted urls for your desired notification services as simple text entries in the
config file. Any recognized notification services will be reported on app start.

##### Apprise Example Config:

```
# Hash Tags denote comment lines and blank lines are allowed
# Discord (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_discord)

https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/{WebhookID}/{WebhookToken}

# Telegram
tgram://{bot_token}/{chat_id}/


# Slack (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_slack)
https://hooks.slack.com/services/{tokenA}/{tokenB}/{tokenC}

```

### Pavlok

To enable shock notifications to
your [Pavlok Shockwatch](https://www.amazon.com/Pavlok-PAV2-PERIMETER-BLACK-2/dp/B01N8VJX8P?), store the url from the
pavlok app in the ```pavlok_config.json``` file, you can copy the template from ```pavlok_config.template_json```.

**WARNING:** This feature does not currently support adjusting the intensity, it will always be max (255).

```json
{
  "base_url": "url goes here"
}
```

### Testing notifications

Once you have setup your `apprise_config.json ` you can test it by running `python app.py test-notifications` from
within your pipenv shell. This will send a test notification to all configured notification services.

## Troubleshooting

+ Re-read this documentation.

+ Verify your JSON.

+ Consider joining the #tech-support channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/5tw6UY7g44) for help from the community if
  these common fixes don't help.

+ **Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary```**
  The issue is that chrome is not installed in the expected location.
  See [Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#requirements) and the section
  on [overriding the Chrome binary location .](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/capabilities#TOC-Using-a-Chrome-executable-in-a-non-standard-location)

  The easy fix for this is to add an option where selenium is used (`selenium_utils.py`)

  ```
  python chrome_options.binary_location = "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
  ```

+ **Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 87```**

  You are not running the proper version of Chrome this requires. As of this update, the current version is Chrome 87.
  Check your version by going to ```chrome://version/``` in your browser. We are going to be targeting the current stable
  build of chrome. If you are behind, please update, if you are on a beta or canary branch, you'll have to build your own
  version of chromedriver-py.

## Frequently Asked Questions

To keep up with questions, the Discord channel [#FAQ](https://discord.gg/GEsarYKMAw) is where you'll find the latest
answers. If you don't find it there, ask in #tech-support.

1. **Can I run multiple instances of the bot?**

   Yes. For example you can run one instance to check stock on Best Buy and a separate instance to check stock on
   Amazon. Bear in mind that if you do this you may end up with multiple purchases going through at the same time.

2. **Does Fairgame automatically bypass CAPTCHA's on the store sites?**
   For Amazon, yes. The bot will try and auto-solve CAPTCHA's during the checkout process.

3. **Does `--headless` work?**
   Yes!  A community user identified the issue with the headless option while running on a Raspberry Pi. This allowed
   the developers to update the codebase to consistently work correctly on headless server environments. Give it a try
   and let us know if you have any issues.

4. **Does Fairgame run on a Raspberry Pi?**
   Yes, with caveats. Most people seem to have success with Raspberry Pi 4. The 2 GB model may need to run the headless
   option due to the smaller memory footprint. Still awaiting community feedback on running on a Pi 3. CPU and memory
   capacity seem to be the limiting factor for older Pi models.
