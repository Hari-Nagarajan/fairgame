## Why???

I built this in response to the severe tech scalping situation that's happening right now. Almost every tech product that's coming
out right now is being instantly brought out by scalping groups and then resold at at insane prices. $699 GPUs are being listed
for $1700 on eBay, and these scalpers are buying 40 carts while normal consumers can't get a single one. Preorders for the PS5 are
being resold for nearly $1000. My take on this is that if I release a bot that anyone can use, for free, then the number of items 
that scalpers can buy goes down and normal consumers can buy items for MSRP. If everyone is botting, then no one is botting. 

## Installation

For Raspberry Pi installation and setup, go [here](#Raspberry-Pi-Setup).

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies. Hop in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) if you have ideas, need help or just want to tell me about how you got your new 3080. [TerryFrench](https://github.com/TerryFrench) has also created a youtube video detailing how to get this project running on Windows 10 as well. Huge thanks to him.

## Usage

Ok now we have a basic GUI. GUIs aren't my strong suit, but pretty much the top box is the settings for amazon and
the bottom box is the settings for Nvidia. 

### Amazon 
- Open a chrome browser
- Log into Amazon
- Go to a product page
- Refresh the page until the 'Buy Now' option exists
- If the price is under the "Price Limit", it will buy the item.

**Amazon flags**
```
--no-image : prevents images from loading on amazon webdriver
```

Example usage:
```
python app.py amazon
Amazon Email []: hari@email.com
Amazon Password []: mypassword
Amazon Item URL []: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW
Maximum Price to Pay [1000]: 1000
...
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:02,199 - Logged in as hari@email.com
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:05,200 - Loading page: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:06,452 - Loaded page for ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 10GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4a, Dual Ball Fan Bearings, Military-Grade Certification, GPU Tweak II)
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:06,474 - Initial availability message is: Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:06,494 - Refreshing page.
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:07,695 - Current availability message is: Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.
```

You can also save your amazon config to your environment variables. This will set them as the defaults in the CLI to save time entering them each time.

**MacOS and Linux Bash Shells**
```
export  amazon_email=user@email.com
export  amazon_password=supersecurepassword
export  amazon_item_url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW?
export  amazon_price_limit=1000
```

**Linux csh/tcsh**
```
setenv  amazon_email user@email.com
setenv  amazon_password supersecurepassword
setenv  amazon_item_url https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW?
setenv  amazon_price_limit 1000
```

**Windows**
```
set amazon_email=user@email.com
set amazon_password=supersecurepassword
set amazon_item_url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW?
set amazon_price_limit=1000
```


### Nvidia 
Will check stock and open an add to cart link in your browser and send notifications.

**Nvidia flags**
```
--test : runs a test of the checkout process, without actually making the purchase
--interval: How many seconds between each stock check (default: 5)
```

Example usage:
```
python app.py nvidia
What GPU are you after?: 3080
What locale shall we use? [en_us]:
...
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,152 - We have 1 product IDs for NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3080
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,153 - Product IDs: ['5438481700']
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,153 - Checking stock for 5438481700 at 5 second intervals.
```

Quick run:
```
python app.py nvidia --gpu 3080 --locale en_us
```

## Best Buy
This is fairly basic right now. Just login to the best buy website in your default browser and then run the command as follows:

```
python app.py bestbuy --sku [SKU]
```

Example:
```
python app.py bestbuy --sku 6429440
```

## EVGA
Make a copy of `evga_config.template_json` to `evga_config.json`:
```
{
  "username": "hari@",
  "password": "password!",
  "card_pn": "10G-P5-3895-KR",
  "card_series": "3080",
  "credit_card" : {
            "name": "Hari ",
            "number": "234234",
            "cvv": "123",
            "expiration_month": "12",
            "expiration_year": "2023"
        }
}
```

Test run command (Uses old gpu list and then stops before finishing the order)
`python app.py evga --test`

Autobuy command:
`python app.py evga --model [indentifier]`

These are the series: "3090" or "3080" (any should work, untested)

P/N numbers can be found in URLs or on product pages such as newegg. They look like this:
10G-P5-3895-KR
10G-P5-3881-KR
10G-P5-3885-KR
![EVGA PN Screenshot](evga_pn.png)

if it doesn't load the correct page title (since the 3090 isn't listed yet), it will refresh every second until the correct page is loaded.


### Notifications
This uses a notifications handler that will support multiple notification channels. 

#### Twilio
To enable Twilio notifications, first go to https://www.twilio.com/ and create a free account and get a Twilio number.
Then make a copy of `twilio_config.template_json` and name it `twilio_config.json`. If this file exists and the credentials are
valid, the notification handler will send you an sms when it carts or purchases an item.
```
{
  "account_sid": "ACCOUNT_SID",
  "auth_token": "AUTH_TOKEN",
  "from": "YOUR TWILIO NUMBER",
  "to": "THE NUMBER YOU WANT TO SEND SMS TO"
}
```

#### Discord
To enable Discord notifications, first get your wehbook url. Use the directions [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to get the webhook url.
Make a copy of the `discord_config.template_json` file and name it `discord_config.json` and place the webhook url here. 
```
{
  "webhook_url": "Discord webhook url here"
}
```

#### Telegram
To enable Telegram notifications, you have to create a new bot and get your chat id. Use the directions [here](https://medium.com/@ManHay_Hong/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-and-send-messages-with-python-4cf314d9fa3e) (Creating your bot and Getting your Chat id sections).

Make a copy of the `telegram_config.template_json` file and name it `telegram_config.json` and place your `BOT_TOKEN` and `BOT_CHAT_ID` values here. 
```
{
    "BOT_TOKEN" : "1234567890:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
    "BOT_CHAT_ID" : "111222333"
}
```

It is possible to notify multiple users at once. Just add a list as the `BOT_CHAT_ID` value:

```
{
    "BOT_TOKEN" : "1234567890:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
    "BOT_CHAT_ID" : ["111222333", "444555666"]
}
```

#### Pavlok
To enable shock notifications to your [Pavlok Shockwatch](https://www.amazon.com/Pavlok-PAV2-PERIMETER-BLACK-2/dp/B01N8VJX8P?),
store the url from the pavlok app in the ```pavlok_config.json``` file, you can copy the template from ```pavlok_config.template_json```.

**WARNING:** This feature does not currently support adjusting the intensity, it will always be max (255).
```
{
  "base_url": "url goes here"
}
```



## Troubleshooting

I suggest joining the #Support channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) for personal assistance if these common fixes don't help.

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary```** 
The issue is that chrome is not installed in the expected location. See [Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#requirements) and the section on [overriding the Chrome binary location .](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/capabilities#TOC-Using-a-Chrome-executable-in-a-non-standard-location)

The easy fix for this is to add an option where selenium is used (amazon.py)
```
chrome_options.binary_location="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 85```**

You are not running the proper version of Chrome this requires. As of this update, the current version is Chrome 85. Check your version by going to ```chrome://version/``` in your browser. We are going to be targeting the current stable build of chrome. If you are behind, please update, if you are on a beta or canary branch, you'll have to build your own version of chromedriver-py.

## Raspberry-Pi-Setup
