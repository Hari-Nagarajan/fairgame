## Why???

I built this in response to the severe tech scalping situation that's happening right now. Almost every tech product that's coming
out right now is being instantly brought out by scalping groups and then resold at at insane prices. $699 GPUs are being listed
for $1700 on eBay, and these scalpers are buying 40 carts while normal consumers can't get a single one. Preorders for the PS5 are
being resold for nearly $1000. My take on this is that if I release a bot that anyone can use, for free, then the number of items 
that scalpers can buy goes down and normal consumers can buy items for MSRP. If everyone is botting, then no one is botting.

## Installation

For Raspberry Pi installation and setup, go [here](#Raspberry-Pi-Setup).

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies. Hop in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) if you have ideas, need help or just want to tell me about how you got your new 3080. 

To get started you'll first need to clone this repository. If you are unfamiliar with Git, follow the [guide on how to do that on our Wiki](https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/nvidia-bot/wiki/How-to-use-GitHub-Desktop-App). You *can* use the "Download Zip" button on the GitHub repository's homepage but this makes receieving updates more difficult. If you can get setup with the GitHub Desktop app, updating to the latest version of the bot takes 1 click.

[TerryFrench](https://github.com/TerryFrench) has also created a youtube video detailing how to get this project running on Windows 10 as well. Huge thanks to him.

## Usage

### Amazon 

***Warning***: This will buy every ASIN that is in stock the first time anything is in stock. So there is a possibility you can end up with multiple items.
Thankfully Amazon.com has 1 click order canceling so its not a huge issue. We are working on a solution for this and price limits soon.

**Amazon flags**
```
--no-image : prevents images from loading on amazon webdriver
--test : This will not finish the checkout
```

Make a copy of `amazon_config.template_json` to `amazon_config.json`:
```json
{
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "asin_list": ["B07JH53M4T","B08HR7SV3M"],
  "amazon_website": "www.amazon.com",
  "reserve": 1000
}
```
* `reserve` is the most amount you want to spend, ensures you don't buy scalper stuff

Example usage:

```
python app.py amazon --test

```

### Nvidia 
**NOTE**:
**As of [October 19, 2020](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/402196/updated-1019-nvidia-store-update-geforce-rtx-3080-/), NVIDIA has indicated that they are no longer selling the Founder's Edition on the NVIDIA store in the US. It is possible they may continue selling them in Europe at a future date, however the bot may not be functional if they modify the store interface before they add new cards to the website. At this point, the NVIDIA store portion of the bot is deprecated.**

Will check stock and open an add to cart link in your browser and send notifications.

**Nvidia flags**
```
--test : runs a test of the checkout process, without actually making the purchase
--interval: How many seconds between each stock check (default: 5)
```

Example usage:
```python
python app.py nvidia
What GPU are you after?: 3080
What locale shall we use? [en_us]:
...
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,152 - We have 1 product IDs for NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3080
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,153 - Product IDs: ['5438481700']
INFO: "2020-09-23 21:43:56,153 - Checking stock for 5438481700 at 5 second intervals.
```

Quick run:
```python
python app.py nvidia --gpu 3080 --locale en_us
```

## Best Buy
This is fairly basic right now. Just login to the best buy website in your default browser and then run the command as follows:

```
python app.py bestbuy --sku [SKU]
```

Example:
```python
python app.py bestbuy --sku 6429440
```


### Notifications
Notifications are now handled by apprise. Apprise lets you send notifications to a large number of supported notification services.
Check https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki for a detailed list. 

To enable Apprise notifications, make a copy of `apprise_config.template_json` in the `config` directory and name it `apprise_config.json`.
Then add apprise formatted urls for your desired notification services as json blobs. 

Apprise Example blobs:
```json
[
  {
  "url": "tgram://{bot_token}/{chat_id}"
  },
  {
  "url": "twilio://{AccountSID}:{AuthToken}@{FromPhoneNo}/{PhoneNo}"
  },
  {
  "url": "slack://{OAuthToken}/#{channel}"
  }
]
```

#### Pavlok
To enable shock notifications to your [Pavlok Shockwatch](https://www.amazon.com/Pavlok-PAV2-PERIMETER-BLACK-2/dp/B01N8VJX8P?),
store the url from the pavlok app in the ```pavlok_config.json``` file, you can copy the template from ```pavlok_config.template_json```.

**WARNING:** This feature does not currently support adjusting the intensity, it will always be max (255).
```json
{
  "base_url": "url goes here"
}
```


#### Testing notifications

Once you have setup your `apprise_config.json ` you can test it by running `python app.py test-notifications` from within your pipenv shell. This will send a test notification to all configured notification services.

## Troubleshooting

I suggest joining the #tech-support channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) for personal assistance if these common fixes don't help.

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary```** 
The issue is that chrome is not installed in the expected location. See [Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#requirements) and the section on [overriding the Chrome binary location .](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/capabilities#TOC-Using-a-Chrome-executable-in-a-non-standard-location)

The easy fix for this is to add an option where selenium is used (`selenium_utils.py``)
```python
chrome_options.binary_location="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 85```**

You are not running the proper version of Chrome this requires. As of this update, the current version is Chrome 85. Check your version by going to ```chrome://version/``` in your browser. We are going to be targeting the current stable build of chrome. If you are behind, please update, if you are on a beta or canary branch, you'll have to build your own version of chromedriver-py.

## Raspberry-Pi-Setup

1. Prereqs and Setup

pipenv shell 
pipenv install
```
2. Leave this Terminal window open.

3. Open the following file in a text editor: 
```
/home/<YOURUSERNAME>/.local/share/virtualenvs/nvidia-bot-<RANDOMCHARS>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/common/service.py
```
4. Edit line 38 from `self.path = executable` to `self.path = "chromedriver"`, then save and close the file.


5. Back in Terminal...
```shell
python app.py
```

6. Follow [Usage](#Usage) to configure the bot as needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I run multiple instances of the bot? 
Yes. For example you can run one instance to check stock on the Nvidia store and a separate instance to check stock on Amazon. Bear in mind that if you do this you may end up with multiple purchases going through at the same time.

### 2. Does Nvidia Bot automatically bypass CAPTCHA's on the store sites?
* For the Nvidia store, no. The Nvidia bot just notifys you when the desired card is in stock, and tries to add it to your cart. The rest of the checkout process is up to you.
* For Amazon, yes. The bot will try and auto-solve CAPTCHA's during the checkout process.
